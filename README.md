# iAwake
LAHacks 2019
iAwake is an app that works on both iOS and Desktop machines. The goal of the app is for driver safety. Often times, individuals after a long day of work risk danger on their commutes back home potentially falling asleep at the wheel. Whether it be daily commutes, long road trips or even truckers, anyone can benefit from increased road safety. iAwake solves this problem by using computer vision to awake drivers in case they doze at the wheel. Along with this, we have implemented a geolocation notification which will message emergency contacts when the individual dozes off three or more times. Finally the app also directs the driver to the nearest gas station so that they may rest up before continuing their journey safely.
